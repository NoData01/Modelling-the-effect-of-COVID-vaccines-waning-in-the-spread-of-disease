# COVID19-cases-prediction

## Abstract
This paper presents a new compartmental model for studying and simulating the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) spread in Malaysia by incorporating the effect of the COVID-19 vaccine waning. 
Through this study, COVID-19 transmission is investigated by using the daily confirmed cases in Malaysia until August 31, 2021, as the index cases. 
The real COVID-19 data released by the Ministry of Health Malaysia (MOH) are being used to find some of the epidemiological parameters of this system. 
The proposed model is based on a susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered (SEIR) compartmental model. However, to illustrate the objective situation, some additional compartments have been added. 
Furthermore, a mathematical analysis is carried out to find the epidemic equilibrium and the basic reproduction number, R_0 of the proposed model. 
The impact of various embedded parameters such as the transmission rate, vaccination program, outcome of the percentage of the vaccinated population, and the type of the vaccines wanes over time was explained in the numerical results.
Then, the Nelder-Mead algorithm is used as a method in optimization with real data conducted and the prediction on transmission trajectory of COVID-19 with the effect of vaccine waning was produced. 
By comparing all the data obtained, we can conclude that although getting vaccinated against COVID-19 can continue to reduce the risk of infections and death, a COVID booster is recommended for COVID-19 vaccines that have a fast-waning rate. 
Through this paper, herd immunity is expected to be achieved when 80% to 90% of people are needed to be vaccinated.
